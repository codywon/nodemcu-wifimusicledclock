TODO
====
- Optimized memory consumption (the permanent ressource-constrained embedded lua problem)
 - use longer variable names where it does not hurt (currently it is manually minimized)
- Add an interface to receive events from the cloud via mqtt
- Cleanup the code
- Make the web page nicer, less technical
